          <h2 id="launching-and-logging-onto-a-cloud-instance">Launching and logging onto a cloud instance</h2>

<p>Objectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose a cloud platform and learn how to access</li>
  <li>Launch an instance </li>
  <li>Identify the address of your cloud instance </li>
  <li>Log in to your cloud instance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important Caveat</strong>: For many of the above steps, your instructor will have completed these tasks for you. If you are learning on your own, or trying this after the workshop, see the exercises and instructions below. </p>

<h3 id="choosing-a-cloud-platform">Choosing a cloud platform</h3>

<p>The most important thing about <em>The Cloud</em> is choice - instead of purchasing a physical computer, you can obtain on-demand computing at almost any scale. This power comes with advantages and disadvantages:</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of Cloud Computing</strong>
* Access large amounts of computing power on demand
* Full administrative rights - install anything
* Use pre-configured images (software already installed)</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages of Cloud Computing</strong>
* Cloud computing costs money (you must keep track of your costs)
* If you need help, you may not have a local system administrator 
* Images may be poorly documented (you may not be clear on what is installed, or how to use it)</p>

<h3 id="cloud-platform-choices">Cloud platform choices</h3>

<p>There are several cloud providers to choose from. Some scientific clouds may either be free or allocate resources competitively. Commercial clouds are can be very powerful, but choice can be overwhelming. We will cover as much as we you need to get through the Data Carpentry lessons, but you will ultimately need to learn things not covered here so see the documentation below:</p>

<h4 id="commercial-clouds">Commercial Clouds</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html">Amazon Web Services</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart">Google Cloud</a></li>
</ul>

<p>* Coming in 2016</p>

<h2 id="launching-an-cloud-instance-virtual-machine">Launching an Cloud Instance (Virtual Machine)</h2>

<p>We will provide instructions for working on the <em>Amazon</em> and the <em>Atmosphere</em> cloud. Follow the instructions for your platform of choice.</p>

<h3 id="launching-an-instance-on-amazon-web-services">Launching an instance on Amazon Web Services</h3>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Form of payment (credit card)*</li>
  <li>Understanding of Amazon’s billing and payment (See: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-getting-started.html">Getting started with AWS Billing and Cost Management</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>* You can use some of Amazon Web Services for free, or see if you qualify for an AWS Grant (See: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/grants/">https://aws.amazon.com/grants/</a> ) if you are using AWS for education. The free level of service <em>will not</em> be sufficient for working with the amount of data we are using for our lessons. </p>

<h4 id="create-an-aws-account">Create an AWS account</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Go to Amazon Web Services <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">https://aws.amazon.com/</a></li>
  <li>Follow the button to sign up for an account - you will need to agree to Amazon’s terms and conditions and provide credit card information. </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="sign-into-aws-and-launch-an-instance">Sign into AWS and Launch an Instance</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Sign into AWS EC2 Dashboard: <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/</a></li>
  <li>Click the ‘Launch Instance’ button
 <img src="./img/logging-onto-cloud_1.png" alt="" /></li>
  <li>In ‘Step 1’ you will be asked to choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), on the lefthand side, look for ‘Community AMIs’ and then search for <strong>ami-6516b30e</strong>; select this image
 <img src="./img/logging-onto-cloud_2.png" alt="" /></li>
  <li>
    <p>For ‘Choose and Instance Type’ select <strong>t2.medium</strong>; then click ‘Review and Launch’ 
 <img src="./img/logging-onto-cloud_3.png" alt="" />   </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can select larger instances, but these will cost more to run. Also for the ‘Review Instance Launch’ you will get some warning about instance security. We will not go into detail here about security groups. However, you should know that when you launch an instance, you will want to take steps to make sure no one maliciously accesses your instance. For example, never give your security credentials (next step) to another user.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>For the ‘Review Instance Launch’ step, click ‘Launch’</li>
  <li>You will be asked to Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair. Select ‘Proceed without a key pair’ and select the acknowledgement you are given. Then click ‘Launch Instances’
